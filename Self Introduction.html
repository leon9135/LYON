<p>	I want to share a novel that I recently interesting in. That is "1984" by George Orwell.</p>
<p> It's a dystopia novels that published in 1949. Although it had been a long time since it first published, the novel accurately predicted political situations in some countries now. </p>
<p> Right picture is an adapted version of "1984" that I am working on for a lecture about Graphic novel. It's working in process, but I still want to share it, cause I really love this version of "1984."</p>

<p> Also, I like to play skateboard. As long as I learn a new skill, it gives me a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p> I started play skateboard when I was a sophormore. And now, I'm a junior student and going to be a senior. I don't have that much time to play skateboard than before.</p>
